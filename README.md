# Anime-Face-Generation

1. •	Trained a Deep Convolution Generative Adversarial Networks (DCGAN) to generate anime faces.
2. •	Implemented LeakyReLU activation which achieved a stable accuracy at around 64.8% for the discriminator during most of the training.
3. •	The loss for discriminator and generator are 0.62 and 1.10 repectively after 200 epochs
